## I'm migrating away from GitHub

This project is not, and will not, use AI generated code or any AI "powered" tool.  
Fuck copilot, fuck openAI and fuck all the corporate greed shit that is stripping off our privacy, making our life worse and destryoing the planet.  

GitHub (basically Microsoft) is training models with ass-level code, found in the majority of the public (and even) private repositories, to help us produce more ass-level code and making worse products.  

Maybe the funny guy with aviator sunglasses was right.

### I'm still going to contribute in this project... but...

We can meet here: [https://gitea.aidystopia.xyz](https://gitea.aidystopia.xyz/marco/yt-dlp-webui). I'm migrating everything to my presonal gitea.  
See you there!  

Bye :)
